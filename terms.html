                                    Mova Development reserves the right to delay projects for valid reasons, which may include but are not limited to: unforeseen technical challenges, client-requested changes, or force majeure events. In the event of a delay, we commit to communicating promptly and providing justification for the delay. However, Mova Development may delay a project for more than three times within reason.

Refund requests must be submitted in writing and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
